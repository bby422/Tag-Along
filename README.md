# Tag Along

Organize data with the help of your friends.

## Intro (Reasoning)

Information overload is the new norm. As tecnology advances the barriers for
producing and archiving content are considerably lower than a decade ago, the 
availability of works to read, watch and play have grown incredibly.

It is easy to get frustrated when you have a pile of produced or collected 
material with lots of interesting things in there, but only a limited amount 
of time to dig in that pile to organize, classify and filter everything alone. 

And time isn't the only problem, since we do have time to spend on silly games
and social networking hollow interactions. We don't spend time organizing our 
collections better (and sharing the findings with the world), mostly because 
that is a boring task. It is boring as hell and cumbersome.

If only there were some modern and fun ways to help us spend our time in those 
valuable tasksâ€¦

## What is Tag Along

Tag Along is an open project. It is a group experiment in the construction of
tools for cataloging, filter and organizing information that are collaborative, 
distributed, effective, and most of all fun!

We currently have a proof-of-concept-quality multi-player photo labeler 
developed during the 2011's Node Knockout code marathon.

The goal is to improve that tool so it reaches production-ready-quality with 
the input feedbcak and code contributions of anyone interested and then based
on this first experience evolve the code to help solve other usecases, and 
to build a strong community/network of contributors.

## How to contribute

There are a number of different ways to help with this dream: 

* you can use our prototype as it is and share your thoughts
* you can browse the contents of this repository and help writing good documentation
* you can become an investor/supporter by sending any amount of money to our 
kickstarter campaign or to any paypal account of any team member
* you can read our javascript code and send any feedback about what could've 
been done better or differently (if you send a pull request, it is even better!)
* you can test our code on your machines and suggest/submit compatibility patches
* you can download the design mockups and suggest improvements (or even other 
completely different user interfaces)
* you can tweak the tool to fit your personal interests/cases and make this
tweaks public
* any other contributions not listed above (be creative!)
